/*
Explicitly make the `runIde` task depend on creating the JAR of `spoofax.intellij`, because the `org.jetbrains.intellij`
plugin for some reason does not make (or even remove) this dependency, which causes `spoofax.intellij` to not be
recompiled, resulting in all kinds of runtime errors.

My hunch is that this happens because `spoofax.intellij` uses the `org.jetbrains.intellij` plugin to get access to the
IntelliJ API, but is not actually a real plugin and thus we depend on it with a regular Gradle dependency.

We tried getting access to the IntelliJ API via a normal Gradle dependency, but this turns out to the hard because it is
not possible to directly depend on the IntelliJ API. You would need to download a ZIP file, extract it, and add that
directory as an Ivy repository to get access to the IntelliJ API.
